# ðŸ§  MNIST Digit Classifier Web App

A simple Deep Learning project that uses a trained neural network to recognize handwritten digits from uploaded images. Built using **Keras**, **TensorFlow**, and **Streamlit**.


## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Upload a 28x28 grayscale image of a digit (0â€“9)
- Deep learning model predicts the digit with confidence scores
- Web interface built with Streamlit
- Trained on the classic MNIST dataset

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit
- NumPy, PIL (Image handling)
